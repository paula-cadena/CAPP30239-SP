# Unveiling Global Trends: Socioeconomic Patterns Across Nations

**Name**: Paula Cadena

## Subject Area
I plan to explore and visualize census data from multiple countries using the IPUMS International dataset, which provides harmonized individual and household-level data across different nations and time periods. This dataset allows for comparative analysis, making it ideal for examining similarities and differences in key indicators such as income, education, employment, and household composition across various countries. By focusing on these socioeconomic variables, I aim to uncover patterns and trends that highlight how different regions compare in terms of development, social structure, and inequality.

The primary goal of this project is to illustrate these cross-country differences and similarities through a series of static visualizations. This analysis will not only offer insights into the factors that shape individual and household experiences but will also provide a broader understanding of global trends over time. By examining both current and historical data, I hope to identify the shared challenges and unique opportunities faced by different regions, contributing to a deeper understanding of global socioeconomic dynamics.

## Data Source
**Source**: IPUMS International  
**URL**: https://international.ipums.org/international/  
**Description**: IPUMS International is a harmonized collection of census microdata from various countries, facilitating comparative research by consistently coding the data across nations and over time. This dataset contains individual and household-level data across multiple socioeconomic variables, making it suitable for exploring demographic trends and disparities.  
**Size**: I requested data for all available countries and years, totaling 360 samples. Each sample contains at least 10,000 observations, and I have selected 137 variables covering a wide range of subjects. At this stage, I aim to explore the dataset comprehensively before selecting specific subsamples to create the visualizations.

## Possible Visualizations
- **Demographics**: Age distribution comparison between countries
- **Income**: Household income levels across countries
- **Education**: Percentage of individuals with secondary or higher education
- **Employment**: Employment rates and gender differences in employment
- **Household Composition**: Average household size and composition
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Visualizing the geographic distribution of certain indicators (e.g., poverty or employment rates) within selected countries
- **Trends Over Time**: Show how key metrics like income or education have evolved over time

## Questions
- Would it be better to focus on just a few countries in more detail, or should I aim for a broader comparative analysis across many countries?
- Are there specific visualization types that I should prioritize, given the range of variables I'll be working with?
